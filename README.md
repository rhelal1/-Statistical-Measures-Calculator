# Statistical Measures Calculator

This Python program reads a list of numbers from a file and calculates various statistical measures such as average, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `StatisticalMeasures.py` file.
3. Prepare a data file containing a list of numbers, with each number on a separate line.
4. Execute the program by running the following command in your terminal:
Replace `<data_file_path>` with the path to your data file.
5. The program will output the calculated statistical measures: average, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Example

Suppose you have a data file named `numbers.txt` with the following content:

```
10
15
20
25
30
```

You can run the program using the following command:

```
python StatisticalMeasures.py numbers.txt
```

The output will be:

```
Average: 20
Median: 20
Variance: 50
Standard Deviation: 7
